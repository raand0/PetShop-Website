# PetShop-Website
Just a basic Pet Shop Website that i built to get a certificate 2 years ago when i was learning bootstrap and php.

## Features
* Fully responsive
* Secure
* Easy to use and simple design
* Funcional
* Uses a database to fetch data

i was really proud of myself at that time xD. i am sill proud though because that security level is still good.
